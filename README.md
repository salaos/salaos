# Welcome!

I know what some of you are thinking. Nina Saalfrank â€“ is she related to the german TV host from the RTL show "the supernanny"? No. But just like the reality TV Host Katharina Saalfrank was analyzing patterns of family systems, I want to get a closer insight of how design and code is connected with eachother.
Before starting the neuefische frontend developer bootcamp I worked for an advertising agency in Hamburg mostly working on concepts and doing graphic & design stuff. When I was starting to make concepts for the first landingpages for clients I recognzied I really want to know how the code behind them works. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in my media design studies before - but then I forgot about it. And here we are - motivated more than ever. Ready for the next level.

By the way - this is me vs. me with coding skills (soon)
